Codes for computing the solar gyroresonance and free-free radio emissions; both the isothermal plasma and the sources described by the differential emission measure (DEM) and differential density metric (DDM) are supported.

Alexey Kuznetsov, February 2021.

The codes are implemented as Windows/Linux libraries callable from IDL (via call_external function). See the files CallingConventions.pdf and Diagram.pdf in the "doc" folder for more details and calling conventions, and the folder "examples" for the usage examples. 

The folder "binaries" contains the compiled Windows DLL and Linux SO libraries.
